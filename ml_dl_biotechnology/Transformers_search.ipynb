In this report, we present a case involving a 59-year-old patient diagnosed with ATC, who experienced swift local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis following radical thyroidectomy. Comprehensive Sanger sequencing of the resected tumor tissue revealed no mutations in the TERT promoter or the BRAF V600E gene. The patient exhibited rapid recurrence post-surgery and was deemed unsuitable for immediate surgical intervention. The patient was unable to tolerate chemotherapy; therefore, radiotherapy was administered initially to prevent airway compression resulting from disease progression. During the course of radiotherapy, pulmonary metastasis developed, yet the patient remained intolerant to both chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a high expression of PD-L1. Whole exome sequencing (WES) indicated a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 2.98 mut/Mb, microsatellite stability (MSS), and identified 10 missense mutations, 1 nonsense mutation, and 1 frameshift insertion. However, none of these mutations have corresponding targeted therapies. Consequently, we administered tislelizumab as an immunotherapeutic intervention. The patient exhibited significant regression in cervical metastatic lymph nodes and pulmonary metastatic tumors, achieving a sustained remission lasting 14 months, culminating in complete remission, without experiencing any adverse events related to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This case demonstrates the efficacy of second-line monotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for ATC in a patient unable to tolerate chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic anlotinib treatment, thereby offering a viable treatment strategy for ATC patients.\",\n          \"Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is increasingly recognized as a primary treatment option for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), providing a focused treatment for localized tumors. The combination of lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, with PD-1 inhibitors has demonstrated significant survival benefits in HCC. This meta-analysis aims to assess whether the integration of HAIC with lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitors (referred to as the HAIC-L-P group) leads to better treatment effectiveness and security compared to lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitors alone (L-P group) in uHCC.\\nAn exhaustive search of the literature was conducted, including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science, from the start of each database until September 2024, to ensure a thorough and up-to-date compilation of relevant studies. Extract data on outcome measures such as overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events (AEs). Subsequently, meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.4 to quantitatively evaluate the aggregated effect of the HAIC-L-P regimen versus the L-P regimen alone.\\nIn our systematic meta-analysis of eight retrospective cohort studies, the HAIC-L-P regimen demonstrated markedly enhanced OS, with an HR of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.45-0.64; p < 0.00001), and enhanced 1-year and 2-year OS rates. Superior PFS was also observed in the HAIC-L-P group, with an HR of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55-0.75; p < 0.0001), and higher 1-year and 2-year PFS rates. Response rates were markedly higher in the HAIC-L-P group, with an ORR risk ratio of 2.15 (95% CI: 1.84-2.50; p < 0.00001) and a DCR risk ratio of 1.28 (95% CI: 1.20-1.43; p < 0.0001). The AEs classified as grade 3 or above were elevated in the HAIC-L-P group, with notable risk ratios for vomiting, elevated AST, elevated ALT, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and hyperbilirubinemia. No life-threatening AEs were reported.\\nThe HAIC-L-P regimen correlated with enhanced tumor responses and prolonged survival, alongside manageable adverse effects, indicating its potential as a viable therapeutic strategy for individuals afflicted with uHCC.\\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD42024594109.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "Score 0.4556 \t Idx Monoclonal antibody therapy using CD38 as a target remains central to managing human multiple myeloma (MM). CD38 was selected early on as a target for mAb-mediated therapy for MM, driven by findings from an early Cluster of Differentiation (CD) Workshop. The first CD38-targeting antibody to be approved yielded strong trial results, significantly improving survival rates and earning widespread patient acceptance. However, resistance to the therapy later emerged, complicating treatment management. Despite CD38's still central role in MM therapy, too little attention has been paid to its broader roles-not only as a myeloma marker but also as an enzyme and adhesion molecule in physiology. This review, a collaborative effort between basic scientists and clinical experts, explores some of the lesser-known mechanisms of antibody action and interactions with CD38 at key stages of treatment. The review also highlights the relevance of the MM environment, focusing on the importance of the bone marrow (BM) niche. The goal is to identify new agents whose unique properties may enhance tumor eradication. By gaining a deeper understanding of interactions between therapeutic antibodies, myeloma cells, and the tumor microenvironment (TME), it is hoped that previously unrecognized vulnerabilities within the disease may be revealed, paving the way to more effective treatment strategies.\n",

            "Abstract: Monoclonal antibody therapy using CD38 as a target remains central to managing human multiple myeloma (MM). CD38 was selected early on as a target for mAb-mediated therapy for MM, driven by findings from an early Cluster of Differentiation (CD) Workshop. The first CD38-targeting antibody to be approved yielded strong trial results, significantly improving survival rates and earning widespread patient acceptance. However, resistance to the therapy later emerged, complicating treatment management.

            "Score 0.2802 \t Idx Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is difficult to treat due to the lack of clear therapeutic targets. Paclitaxel (PTX) is commonly used to treat TNBC, but drug resistance limits its effectiveness. Myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2) and serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) are involved in various diseases, including infections, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. We investigated their role in PTX resistance to identify potential anti-TNBC drugs. In this study, we investigated the changes of SAA1 in TNBC tissues and its role in PTX-induced TNBC cells. Our study revealed SAA1 expressed in the human TNBC subtype and TNBC cells. PTX and CIS induce SAA1 in TNBC cells, and PTX induces inflammatory response via SAA1 in TNBC cells. MD2 blockade increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to PTX, which was related to the expression of SAA1 during PTX-caused damage of TNBC cells. In further research, SAA1 binds to MD2, promotes the combination of TLR4/MD2 and TLR4/MyD88, activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, and creates the inflammatory microenvironment for cancer cells. Our study reports for the first time that the PTX/SAA1/MD2 axis exists in the PTX-resistance process, which could be a potential treatment target of PTX-resistance.\n",
