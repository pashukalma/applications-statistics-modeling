#### Machine learning in healthcare for disease progression modeling
Learn about diseases using clinical trial data, and unsupervised learning of clinical biomarkers. Address the challenges with data in healthcare being non-linear, or missing, or having complex variation due to treatment protocols, and in cases of rare diseases having a  small number of samples to learn from. Statistical models are used for sequential data with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and [Gaussian] state space models (SSM).  Domain knowledge (like for cancer progression lines of therapy and mechanism drug effect) is incorporated to design deep generative models (neural networks architecture) for clinical trials. Traditional PK-PD models to model dynamics of a single biomarker due to a single drug. Neural network architecture applied to model the effect of multiple simultaneous interventions on latent representations, with the end goal to improve model's ability to generalize and forecast clinical biomarkers. 

#### Use cases similar to develop clinical decision support tools 
Understand the needs of oncologists when treating patients and what forecasting tasks might be of interest  From predictive to counterfactual models use a starting point for model-based reinforcement learning. 
High level knowledge in research opportunities to enhance multi-model decision making oncology in forecasting patient data, predicting time to progression, and likelihood of successful treatment.
